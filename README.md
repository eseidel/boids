# boids

Experimenting with "boids".

Inspired by https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqtqltqcQhw
And http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~dt/siggraph97-course/cwr87/

Currently only tested with the (experimental) Mac harness.
Have not tried to build for iOS, Android, Web or Windows yet.


Known issues
* Steering behavior is wrong.
* No Alignment or Cohesion behavior yet.
